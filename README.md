# Rogue-AC (THIS WILL WORK FOREVER)

[![sampctl](https://shields.southcla.ws/badge/sampctl-Anti_cheat_pack-2f2f2f.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RogueDrifter/Anti_cheat_pack)

This is a pack of 14 anticheats and 3 helping systems which you can control through callbacks mentioned
in the includes and the test.pwn file.

`Installation`: The Rogue-AC file needs to be included in your gamemode and in all filterscripts, function(s) is/are to be used only within the gamemode.

`Testing`: All can be done through the test.pwn folder which already contains all of the includes and their callbacks nottify you through `SCM` and `print` messages

`Version`: `8.0`

# Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install RogueDrifter/Anti_cheat_pack
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <Rogue-AC>
```

# Usage

Use the callbacks provided to you by the includes depending on the type of it.  

If you're including the pack as a whole you'll need to only use the callback `OnPlayerViolate`  

Details for callback:
``forward OnPlayerViolate(playerid, severity, violationCode, const violationName[]);``  
Whereas:  

```
playerid = cheater player id.

severity = how bad cheating is, 
types:
#define SEVERITY_CASE_ONE 0 	//Warn then kick
#define SEVERITY_CASE_TWO 1		//Kick
#define SEVERITY_CASE_THREE 2	//Ban

violationcode: which callback was triggered (codes can be found below in the #CONTAINS section.

violationName: basically a string for the cheat name which makes it easier to write a string.
```  

If you use separate includes you can use the respective callbacks in the test.pwn file.  

If you want to disable any anti cheat when using the Rogue-AC file, you can put this line before the include:  

``#define DISABLE_[anti cheat file name]``  

For example:
``#define DISABLE_JETPACK``  
and so on.  

NOTE: If you don't use the callback, my include will do all the work for you.  

# Testing

Use the test.pwn file and check the server for client messages/log for printed messages.

To test, simply run the package:

```bash
sampctl package run
```

# Contains:

```
#define VIOLATION_CODE_BUGATTEMPT 0
#define VIOLATION_CODE_LAGOUT 1
#define VIOLATION_CODE_SLIDEBUG 2
